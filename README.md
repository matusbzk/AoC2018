# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018">Advent of Code 2018</a>

I'm not sure how much time will I be able to spend on the Advent of Code this december. I'll start by posting a few solutions in Haskell, but then I'll be busy because of my approaching graduation.

Afterwards, I'm planning to learn Python so maybe I'll come back and try to solve it in Python.
